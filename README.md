## Contributing [🡅](#table-of-contents)

If you have an error, bug, or have found an oversight please [leave an issue about it](https://github.com/Yuudaari/fabricate/issues). I'll try to get to them as fast as I can.

If you want to help develop Soulus and already know how to mod, great, make an issue and then a PR if you know what you want to do. If you don't know how to mod, I probably won't have the time to help teach you, but you're welcome to join my [Discord server](https://discord.gg/fwvBfus) and chat/ask questions.

If you have a suggestion you can also [leave them as an issue](https://github.com/Yuudaari/fabricate/issues). I will close suggestions that I dislike or are out of scope for the mod.

If you want to support me financially, consider supporting me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/yuudaari)!
